# OpenSSL
OpenSSL source code (used to build OpenSSL for OSTC team ULINUX builds)

This repository exists for ease of use only, used to configure a system to
properly build universal agents. Similar information is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git).
This repository is just in an easier-to-use form, making it faster to set
up a universal build system with the exact versions of SSL that we need.


#### Cloning this repository

Since this repository has subprojects, it should be cloned with a command like:
<br>```git clone --recursive git@github.com:Microsoft/ostc-openssl.git```

#### Building OpenSSL for universal agents

To build OpenSSL for universal agents, we require building:

- [OpenSSL 0.9.8](https://github.com/Microsoft/ostc-openssl#building-ssl-098)
- [OpenSSL 1.0.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/ostc-openssl#building-ssl-100)
- [OpenSSL 1.1.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/ostc-openssl#building-ssl-110)

##### Building SSL 0.9.8

Untar your distribution file, if necessary, and go into the base
directory of OpenSSL 0.9.8 with a command like:<br>```cd openssl-0.9.8```

Configure the software based on your build system:

- On a CentOS 6.x 64 bit OS, use ```./config no-asm -fPIC --prefix=/usr/local_ssl_0.9.8 shared```

- For all other platforms, use ```./config --prefix=/usr/local_ssl_0.9.8 shared```

After OpenSSL 0.9.8 is properly configured, use the standard mantra:

```
make
make test
sudo make install
```

Note that its normal to sometimes get unit test errors for SSL 0.9.8.
If that happens, just proceed to 'sudo make install'.

##### Building SSL 1.0.0

Untar your distribution file, if necessary, and go into the base
directory of OpenSSL 1.0.0 with a command like:<br>```cd openssl-1.0.0```

To configure and build SSL 1.0.0, use the following commands:

```
./config --prefix=/usr/local_ssl_1.0.0 shared -no-ssl2 -no-ec -no-ec2m -no-ecdh
make depend
make
make test
sudo make install_sw
```

Unlike SSL 0.9.8, we've never seen unit test failures for SSL 1.0.0.

Notes for SSL configuration:

- Note: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8206546/undefined-symbol-sslv2-method discusses why the -no-ssl2 qualifier is now required for compatibility with newer Ubuntu systems, depending on APIs utilized by the SSL client.

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22311699/trouble-with-openssl-on-rhel-6-3-and-all-ruby-installers describes why we need to specify the -no-ec2m flag.

##### Building SSL 1.1.0

NOTE: Build of SSL 1.1.0 needs a more recent version of Perl than most
of our universal build systems have.

Note that we've had problems buliding with "very" bleeding edge versions
(like v5.26.0), so we've stepped back to prior versions.

This PERL from source can be achieved by using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Perl/perl5.git 
pushd perl5/
git checkout v5.24.1
./Configure -des -Dprefix=/usr/local_perl_5_24_1
make test
sudo make install
```

Once you have built PERL (if needed), untar your distribution file,
if necessary, and go into the base directory of OpenSSL 1.1.0 with a
command like:<br>```cd openssl-1.1.0```

If you needed to build PERL from source, be sure to place the new version
of PERL first in your PATH environment variable, like this:

```
export PATH=/usr/local_perl_5_24_1/bin:$PATH
```

To configure and build SSL 1.1.0, use the following commands:

```
./config --prefix=/usr/local_ssl_1.1.0 shared -no-ssl2 -no-ec -no-ec2m -no-ecdh
make depend
make
make test
sudo make install_sw
```

### Closing notes

We need these installed ONLY on ULinux build systems
(i.e. RedHat 32-bit and 64-bit, depending on the product(s) involved).
No other systems need these kits.

Note that the ./config line utilize the --prefix option. The directory
paths for the prefix (```/usr/local_ssl_0.9.8``` and
```/usr/local_ssl_1.0.0```) are hard-coded in our make process.  You can't
change that without careful consideration, as it would impact the build
procedures for numerous projects.

Finally, note that these bits are both installed <b>regardless</b> of the
version of SSL installed on the system. Furthermore, nothing (other than
our kit) links against these. No system software uses the SSL versions
in these locations.
